          Ensuring customer satisfaction has always been our utmost priority.
          Our primary goal is to assure that customer shipments are delivered
          safely and within the allotted time interval.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Our team closely monitors all packages from dispatch until their

          Shipping Process &amp; Procedure
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Product(s) are dispatched from the seller to our warehouse facility.
          The products(s) are then thoroughly examined at our warehouse facility
          before they are dispatched to our customers. We carry out timely
          delivery of these shipments using 3rd party courier services that
          deliver orders to customers on our behalf.
        </p>
        <h2 className="h2 poppins-font mb-1 mt-3 mb-0">Shipping Options:</h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          When you place an order, you can choose the delivery options at
          checkout. The tentative date mentioned in the product description has
          a significant impact on the shipment's transit time.
        </p>
        <h2 className="h2 poppins-font mb-1 mt-3 mb-0">Shipping Charges:</h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          The total shipping charges are calculated at the checkout page. The
          shipping charges vary depending on the product's weight and size as
          well as on the selected shipping option. Shipping charges will change
          with each additional item that is added to your cart. Customers can
          save more on shipping by increasing their basket size instead of
          making single item orders.

              According to the international aviation organisation's norms and

              gases, liquid gases, oxidising agents, and flammable solids are

              The courier company usually takes care of the customs clearance
