        <p className="mb-3">
          In the event of a return, the refund process will begin only after the
          product has been received, inspected &amp; examined at our warehouse
          facility, indicating that it meets the eligibility criteria. Refund
          approval or rejection depends upon the investigation carried out by
          the responsible team.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Once we initiate a refund, it will take approximately 7-10 business
          days for the amount to reflect in the original payment method.
          However, the same varies according to the bank's settlement standards.
          In the case of UCredit the amount will reflect in your Ubuy account
          within 24-48 working hours. Please contact our support team for more
          information.
